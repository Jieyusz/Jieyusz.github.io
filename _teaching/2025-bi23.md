# Course description 

This 3-unit tutorial offers an engaging exploration of ethology, focusing on how non-human animals learn. We will begin with foundational theories from Charles Darwin and continue learning about the modern ethology, established by Nobel laureates Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz. We will also cover behaviorism, including work from Ivan Pavlov and B.F. Skinner. The course will then introduce current advancements in neuroethology, computational ethology, and the intersection of biological intelligence and artificial intelligence, featuring guest presentations from researchers in these fields. Throughout the term, students will enjoy a range of readings on animal behaviors in both field and laboratory settings. The course will conclude with a mini ethology project through expert-guided fieldwork. The take-home lesson for the students would not only include an overview of the science of learning, but also an appreciation of behavior as a language of the nature, and perhaps even a special skillset to teach their pets new tricks.
