Chen Institute Workshop on Cross-Species Modalities in Cognition and Behavior

The Chen Institute for Neuroscience at Caltech is sponsoring its next workshop on Cross-Species Modalities in Cognition and Behavior. The workshop will explore human and animal comparison studies as well as research on cognition and behavior in different model organisms.

The Chen Institute workshop series is designed to introduce non-neuroscientists to some of the challenging problems facing our understanding of brain function, as well as to bring them up to date on the state-of-the-art knowledge and methods in different sub-fields of neuroscience. The goal of these workshops is to promote discussion and to forge new interactions and cross-divisional collaborations at Caltech.

The workshop will be moderated by Colin Camerer and Carlos Lois.
