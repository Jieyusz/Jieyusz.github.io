Talk abstract 
------

Human intelligence is often seen as unique and superior to that of other animals, including mice. The human neocortex and hippocampus are considered essential neural substrates for advanced cognition, such as flexible decision-making and long-term memory formation. Accordingly, much rodent research focuses on the role of the cortex in learning and memory. We designed a novel navigation task, the "Manhattan Maze", to study the cognitive capacity of mice and the role of cortex in it. ​

The Manhattan Maze is easily reconfigurable and allows systematic task designs in a vast space of 2<sup>121</sup> possible maps. In just two days, completely naïve wildtype mice quickly learned to navigate their first map in ~10 roundtrips, retained overnight memory of the same map, and showed accelerated learning in new configurations. We also tested the maze on acortical mice— a structural mutant born without both the hippocampus and most of the neocortex. Surprisingly, these mice learned multiple maps and could solve the same map after a two-month break, suggesting that the cortex was not strictly required for learning and memorizing the Manhattan Maze.​

These findings raise fundamental questions about the role of the cortex in cognition. In the final part, I’ll discuss an unresolved brain paradox: the vast gap between its gigabits/s sensory inputs and 10 bits/s behavioral output. Exploring the reasons behind this paradox will shed light on the unique role of the cortex and organizing principles of the brain.
