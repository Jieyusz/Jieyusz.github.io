**I am currently seeking postdoctoral positions starting in 2026** to continue investigating cognition in animals. I would be excited to join a theory- and computation-focused group, or a neuroethology lab aiming to uncover the fundamental principles of biological intelligence. If you are looking for insights from a well-trained ethologist who can “whisper” to your animals and bring out their best, please reach out!

I am a PhD student in the Neurobiology program at the California Institute of Technology ([Caltech](https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/)), advised by Prof. [Markus Meister](https://meisterlab.caltech.edu/markusmeister). My research focuses on cognitive flexibility, learning, and memory, with particular interest in the role of neocortex and hippocampus in these functions. My current project, [*Mice in the Manhattan Maze*](https://jieyusz.github.io/publication/manhattan), uses an original massively reconfigurable maze to study rapid learning, long-term memory and generalization in wildtype mice and acortical mice. I recently published a perspective about the biggest mystery of the human brain titled ["the Unbearable Slowness of Being"](https://jieyusz.github.io/publication/2024_zheng_slowness) on [Neuron](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.11.008), which explores the speed of cognition using information theory.

Beyond research, I am actively involved in teaching and student activities at Caltech. I developed my own 10-week tutorial [Bi23 Sec1 Learning Across Species](https://jieyusz.github.io/teaching/2025-bi23) in Winter 2025. For two years, I served as the head teaching assistant for CNS187 *Neural Computation*, a graduate-level course requirement for students in Computation and Neural System. Additionally, I am the current president of the [Neurotechers](https://neurotechers.caltech.edu/) (23-), the official club for Caltech graduate students in neuroscience. You can learn more about me in a short [Spotlight](https://thisis.caltech.edu/person-spotlight-listing?p=2) on Caltech's frontpage, and a short assay about the [best students in class](https://magazine.caltech.edu/post/caltech-initiative-for-students). 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the mountains, hiking in the summer and skiing in the winter. In 2024, I summitted [Mt Whitney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Whitney) in one day. I am also an avid bird watcher, wildlife columnist, artist and photographer (check my [art portfolio](https://jieyusz.github.io/portfolio/)!). 

Before joining Caltech, I did my undergraduate studies at Cornell University (B.S. in Biological Engineering) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (B.Eng. in Food Science and Engineering). I then obtained a Master's degree (M.Phil) in Education and Psychology from the University of Cambridge.
