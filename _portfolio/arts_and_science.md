Original design for the neurotecher tote bag, 2024

This tote bag was designed by me as part of the Neurotechers Art Contest. The artwork depicts a dynamic rivalry between the biological intelligence (Neuro) and artificial intelligence (Tech). The biological rat "Neuro" sends an action potential through a head stage. The neural signal is transmitted via the Caltech brain-machine interface, highlighting our collective efforts in the field. The robotic rat receives the signal and emits a low-pass filter voltage profile. The two rats are engaged in a game of Go: the biological rat makes the first move (playing with black stones), and the robotic rat catches up (playing with white stones). The game copies a segment of the historic last match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol, where AlphaGo ultimately won.
