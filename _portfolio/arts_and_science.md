Original design for the neurotecher tote bag, 2024
------

<img src="/images/neurotech.jpeg" alt="Neurotech Image" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">

This tote bag was designed by me as part of the Neurotechers Art Contest. The artwork depicts a dynamic rivalry between the biological intelligence (Neuro) and artificial intelligence (Tech). The biological rat "Neuro" sends an action potential through a head stage. The neural signal is transmitted via the Caltech brain-machine interface, highlighting our collective efforts in the field. The robotic rat receives the signal and emits a low-pass filter voltage profile. The two rats are engaged in a game of Go: the biological rat makes the first move (playing with black stones), and the robotic rat catches up (playing with white stones). The game copies a segment of the historic last match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol, where AlphaGo ultimately won.

My winning design for the t-shirt design contest for the Caltech Neurotechers club. Prof. Pietro Perona once commented that this painting looks "creepy" and that I should try a different theme.

**Title**: Caltech Logo 2020, colourised

**Medium**: coloured pencils

**Dimensions**: 53 cm x 76 cm (21’’ x 30’’)
 
**Description**: An attempt to appreciate diversity intuitively as we do nature. Many share the same colours, and many with the same colours are very different. Our love for each other is as instinctive as our love for a delicious rainbow ice cream.
 

The piece should take on a different look farther away and up front. Caltech community is able to recognize the “parody” of our Caltech logo at distance: the two beavers as the hands, the ice cream as the torch. (You can juxtapose the two.) A closer look of it is meant to inspire thoughts about the symbols in the drawing: beavers as Caltechers, rainbow ice cream as a pride symbol, phoenix (a genderless legendary bird); different cultures/countries and majors (monarch butterfly, Saturn, papaya, volcano, etc.). I also want it to fit the autumn/thanksgiving theme and the ambience of Café. Though the drawing itself might take some time for one to relate to diversity, I believe it would be a light-hearted addition to other works in display.
